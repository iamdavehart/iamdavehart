# i am dave hart 👋 

Hi! I'm Dave and I live and work in London as a technology consultant. I've got 20+ years experience in writing code, analysing data and generally mucking around with technology. You can find me working with javascript, node, react, python, C#, rust, solidity, anything someone will pay my day-rate for... Occasionally, you'll see me in the tube tunnels singing to strangers...
